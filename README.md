# description
This application registers work data for specified work hours during a specified period.<br>
The regular time set in the attendance management system and the actual regular time are different,<br>
and It is troublesome to set from a pull-down menu with one increment,<br>
so I created this application for my colleagues.

# dev env
- Windows 10
- Python 3.9.13
- Selenium 4.6.0
